About
-----

After trying out Lisping and Gambit REPL on my iPad, I was left wanting more.  These are great for certain tasks, but the included libraries are lacking in terms of cool things you can do.  Scheme2Go was written with the end goal of creating a usable Scheme environment that works well mobile but can also be used from any modern browser.  It's in a rough state now but the basic repl functionality is there.

The eventual goal is to allow tcp client connections (via websockets) and add a dsl for easily working with HTML5 canvas.  I'll probably pepper in other things as I think of them as well.

Dependencies
